Hey look, there's text in here now.

Oops, I got rid of text.

Here's a bunch more!
	Hello, my name is Carl Geoffrey Huliggen, and I am a hooligan.
	If you're a hooligan like me, you may have some trouble with people in authority.
	So today I'm introducing "Huliggen's Hooli-Gone."
	It's a deodorant that makes people think you're not a hooligan, even though you are.
	This way, you can have the respect of your teachers and parents without giving up your hooligan-esque tendencies.
	And it's ONLY two billion payments of three billion dollars each!
	For more info, call "1-888-555-DONT-TOUCH-THAT."
